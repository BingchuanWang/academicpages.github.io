I am currently an assistant professor in School of Automation, Central South University. I am also with the [CITAA Group](https://intleo.csu.edu.cn/index.html) led by Prof. Yong Wang. I recieved my Bachelor degree and Master degree both in School of Automation, Central South University and the Ph.D. degree in Department of Systems Engineering and Engineering Management, City University of Hong kong under the supervision of Prof. [Han-Xiong Li](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/seem/mehxli/).

Research Interests
------
My research interests include data-driven modeling and optimization with applications to lithium-ion batteries. Specifically, I am interested in:
- Evolutionary computation for constrained optimization, constrained multiobjective optimization, and constrained expensive optimization.
- Data-driven methods (e.g. Gaussian process, RBFNN, deep learning) for modeling of distributed parameter systems.
- Modeling and optimization for battery management using the above methods
